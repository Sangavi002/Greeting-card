# Greeting-card

Observations and Learnings:

1. React Components: Code defines with two components: GreetingCard and App, following React's component-based approach for UI development.

2. State Management: The useState hook in the App component manages the greeting card content's state, enabling dynamic rendering based on data changes.

3. Rendering Logic: Within App, content state is mapped to render multiple GreetingCard components, illustrating React's efficient handling of dynamic component lists.

4. Styling: CSS styles the layout and appearance of greeting cards and the main container, utilizing CSS grid and box-shadow for visual effects.

5. Inline Styling: Inline styles in JSX allow dynamic styling based on component state or props.

6. React Root: A root element (div with id root) is created for rendering the React application, managed by React DOM.
